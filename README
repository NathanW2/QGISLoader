## QGIS Loader

A utillty for loading different installed QGIS versions.

### Features

- Jump list of installed QGIS versions for quick access
- List of recent projects

Will do other things in the future so what this space.

## Why?

On windows QGIS is loaded using a .bat file that setups up the environment. 
This is not ideal as you can't pin it to the task bar without doing a workaround
as well as raising some other install issues.

This utility will be able to bootstrap the QGIS load so that it's not called with a 
batch file but with a real exe that can be pinned to start

In future versions of QGIS we will use a real exe to load QGIS but this works for older versions
